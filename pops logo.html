        <h1>Video recommendation system for millions of online viewers in SEA market</h1>
        <h2>Customer: POPS Worldwide</h2>
        <p>
            Built a recommendation system for over nine million online viewers based on their video viewing history, from which the system will recommend videos that are deemed relevant to viewers' preferences. In that project, we helped the partner to improve the clicking rate twice compared to the previous approach and integrate the recommendation system in the production environment of the company. Our work was then extended for other contents, including comics and songs.
